# Hex Worlds client

ThreeJS React app with Phoenix backend for generating hexagon-based worlds and seeing them in 3D.

## Installation

Clone repo, then run:

`yarn install`

It is also possible to use `npm install` to achieve that,
but we recommend using `yarn` for its much better version locking system.

Then:

`yarn start`

to start development server

## Testing

Just run:

`yarn test`

## Things to do in near future:

- Try to migrate data structure to [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) and see how it will affect performance on larger maps,
- Add new page to debug and preview different tile types
- Increase test coverage
- Add more terrain types and assets placed on tiles (like villages, caves, etc.)

## Note

This project is being made as a hobby in my free time, feel free to contribute or ask about anything here :)
