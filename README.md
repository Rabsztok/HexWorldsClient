# Hex Worlds client

ThreeJS React app with Phoenix backend for generating hexagon-based worlds and seeing them in 3D.

[See it in action](https://hex-worlds-client.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

Clone repo, then run:

`yarn install`

You can also use `npm install` if you prefer.

Then:

`yarn start`

to start development server

## Testing

Just run:

`yarn test`

## Things to do in near future:

- ~Try to migrate data structure to [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) and see how it will affect performance on larger maps~
- Increase test coverage
- Add more terrain types and assets placed on tiles (like villages, caves, etc.)
- ~Use InstancedBufferGeometry with some shaders to speed up rendering~

## Note

This project is being made as a hobby in my free time, feel free to contribute or ask about anything here :)
